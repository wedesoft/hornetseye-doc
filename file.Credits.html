<p>Yukihiro Matsumoto and his team are providing a proper programming language with a simple way of interfacing with native code.</p>

<p>Masahiro Tanaka develops NArray which offers great ideas on how to do image processing with Ruby.</p>

<p>Greg Valure is the developer of NaturalDocs which is used to generate this webpage.</p>

<p>The folks at <a href="http://www.demon.net/">Demon</a> are hosting this webpage.</p>

<p>This project makes use of free hosting at <a href="http://rubyforge.org/">RubyForge</a>, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/">Sourceforge</a>, <a href="http://launchpad.net/">Launchpad</a>, and <a href="http://github.com/">Github</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks to Ashley Moran and Jag Gill for organizing the 7th Sheffield Ruby User Group meeting and letting me present HornetsEye there.</p>

<p>The conference organizers from OSCON 2008 accepted my proposal to give a talk and this gives this project a boost in popularity.</p>

<p>Thanks to Klaus Treichel, Aleksey Demakov, and Kirill Kononenko for their valuable support with libJIT.</p>

<p>Thanks to Andrey Turkin for contributing compatibility fixes for the FFmpeg bindings.</p>

<p>Thanks to Damien Douxchamps for his support with libdc1394.</p>

<p>Thanks to Richard Dale for his support with qt4-qtruby.</p>

<p>Paul Brannan develops ruby-libjit and the libjit interface of HornetsEye follows the pattern of ruby-libjit.</p>

<p>Thanks to Caleb Clausen for helping me with Rubygems.</p>

<p>The phase correlation example is based on Dennis Tessier’s work.</p>

<p>Hussein Abdul-Rahman contributed the initial version (two-dimensional) of the connected-component analysis.</p>

<p>The interactive presentation software is based on the experience gained in a previous project by Juan Roldan, Ushakiran Soutapalli, Julien Faucher, and Claudia Amico.</p>

<p>Kim Chuan Lim implemented various sub-pixel corner detection algorithms with Ruby.</p>

<p>Aiden Lockwood implemented software for operating a transmission electron microscope using Ruby and HornetsEye. Jing Jing Wang, Jong Peng, and Ralph Gay helped understanding the controller.</p>

<p>Géraud De La Mensbruge used HornetsEye for inspection of industrial SMT nozzles.</p>

<p>Chinwe Lucy Ozoegwu implemented a graphical user interface for displaying, processing, and recording of infrared videos.</p>

<p>Sonia Fernández Rodríguez did an implementation of the RANSAC algorithm with Ruby.</p>

<p>Bala Amavasai developed a large part of the Mimas library and he organised the Nanorobotics grant. HornetsEye benefits a lot from experience gained during the development of the Mimas C++ computer vision library.</p>

<p>Jan Wedekind initiated this project and currently is the main developer of this software.</p>

<p>Thanks to the members of the Microsystems and Machine Vision Laboratory for their suggestions, support, and for using this software ;)</p>

<p>The people at Sheffield Hallam University and the Materials and Engineering Research Institute are supporting us and there is a long lasting commitment to free software by management.</p>

<p>There are a lot of developers who have developed other open-source software on which this library is based upon.</p>

<p>Thanks to all developers using this library for their valuable feedback!</p>

<p>Part of the work was funded by the <a href="http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/ViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=GR/S85696/01">EPSRC Nanorobotics Basic Technology grant</a>.</p>
