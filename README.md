HornetsEye - Computer Vision for the Robotic Age
================================================

**HornetsEye** is a **real-time computer vision library** for the **Ruby programming language**. HornetsEye is maybe the first free software project providing a **solid platform for implementing real-time computer vision software** in a scripting language. The platform potentially could be used in **industrial automation**, **robotic applications**, and **human computer interfaces**.

HornetsEye is free software. Researchers and developers are not degraded to mere consumers but are given the full freedom to study the source code, run, modify, and redistribute the software as they wish.

The logo shows a honeycomb structure as you would find on an insect's compound eye. A hornet is capable of navigating and detecting objects with the limited resolution of its compound eyes.
