HornetsEye - Computer Vision for the Robotic Age
================================================

**HornetsEye** is a **real-time computer vision library** for the **Ruby programming language**. HornetsEye is maybe the first free software project providing a **solid platform for implementing real-time computer vision software** in a scripting language. The platform potentially could be used in **industrial automation**, **robotic applications**, and **human computer interfaces**.

HornetsEye is free software. Developers and users are given the full freedom to study the source code, run, modify, and redistribute the software as they wish.

The logo shows a honeycomb structure as you would find on an insect's compound eye. A hornet is capable of navigating and detecting objects with the limited resolution of its compound eyes.
